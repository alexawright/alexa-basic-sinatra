          %h6 Hi, I'm Alexa.
          %p
            I'm a Brooklyn-based creative designer. I design everything from brand identities to websites and stuffed animals. Regardless of what I'm making, I focus on ease of use + wear, balance, and minimalism. 

            When I'm not designing, I enjoy cooking, doing yoga, and all forms of comedy.

            Have a fun project for me to work on?
