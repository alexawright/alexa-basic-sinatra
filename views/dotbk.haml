  %h2 dotBK Brand Identity
  %p The dotBK scissor trademark reflects dotBK's roots as a small family business of clothiers based in New Yorkâ€™s garment district. It also speaks to the creative spirit of the artists and innovators who inspire and wear their clothing, those who understand and appreciate craftsmanship and authenticity.
  %p The unique shape of the scissor subtly mimics a backwards letter B and K, differentiating the icon from other scissor iconography, and allows for brand association. The trademark holds great potential for playful exploration within garment details and print development.
